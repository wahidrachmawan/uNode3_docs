# Throw

![](../../images/node-reference/throw.png)

The **`Throw` node** is used to **manually raise an exception** (error) during graph execution. This is useful for stopping execution when an unexpected condition occurs, or for debugging and validation purposes.

It behaves similarly to the `throw` statement in C#.

### ðŸ”§ How It Works

- Takes an input of type `Exception` or a message (string) to create and throw a runtime exception.
- When executed, it interrupts the flow and throws the exception immediately.
- If uncaught, the exception halts the graph or the application (just like standard C# behavior).
