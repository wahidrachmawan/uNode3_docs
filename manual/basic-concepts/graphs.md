# Graphs

One of uNode key components is the graph. Graphs are visual representations of the logic in an application.

## Runtime Graphs

The Runtime Graphs can be referenced by other graphs directly without needed you to compile it into c# scripts. Runtime Graph can be run in both reflection and native c#. When the graph is not compiled, the graph is run with reflection which is slow compared to native but allow you to live edit it in playmode (You can also press save at the top left of the editor to save your changes during playmode). And if the graph has been compiled the graph will be run with native c# which give you a performance boost but in return this doesn‚Äôt support live edit graph.

Here is the graph that is categorized as Runtime Graphs:

- Class Definition ( Class Component, Class Asset, and all of class definition models )
- Graph Component

<!-- - Class Singleton -->

## C# Graphs

The C# Graphs are designed to create a pure c# scripts, this allow you to create from game logic to editor extensions but like its name the c# graphs can only be used by compiling it into c# scripts. This is the only graph that, when compiled to c# script can be used completely separately from the uNode Visual Scripting asset.

Here is the graph that is categorized as C# Graphs:

- C# Class
- C# Struct
- C# Enum
- C# Interface

## Types of Graphs

uNode has many different types of graphs, each of them can serve for different purpose.
Here is the list of avalaible graphs types:

| Graph           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class Component | A `Class Definition` model that inherited from MonoBehaviour                                                                                                                                                    |
| Class Asset     | A `Class Definition` model that inherited from ScriptableAsset                                                                                                                                                  |
| Class Object    | A `Class Definition` model that inherited from System.Object                                                                                                                                                    |
| Class Singleton | A runtime graph that's inherit from MonoBehaviour but act like Static Classes `<br>` This graph can be accessed from anywhere but it is guarantee that this graph only one instance can exist at the same time. |
| Graph Component | A graph like Class Component but added directly to GameObjects via 'add component'. It can reference any object in its current scene                                                                              |
| C# Class        | A c# graph that's intended for visually creating c# class. It can be inherited from any of C# Scripts and implementing any of C# Interfaces                                                                       |
| C# Struct       | A c# graph that's intended for visually creating c# struct. It can implementing any of C# Interfaces                                                                                                              |

Features Description

- Reflection Mode	: For executing graph with reflection mode.
- Live Edit			: For live editing graph during playmode.
- Attributes		: Attributes for classes, variables, properties, and functions. A partial mean that the attributes is only work on running with Native C# mode.
- Modifiers			: Modifiers for classes, variables, properties, and functions. A partial mean that it only have public and private modifier.
- Inheritance		: Support of Inheritance. Inheritance enables you to create new graph that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other graph / c# classes.
- Interfaces		: The supported interface implementations, it is C# Interface of Graph Interface.

## Types of Graph Canvas

uNode has two different types of graph canvas: Flow Graphs and State Graphs.

### Flow Graphs

Flow Graphs control and connect specific actions and values. The actions in a Flow Graph happen in a specific order. Actions could happen every frame, or when a specific event occurs.

uNode represents the actions in a Flow Graph through nodes.

In a Flow Graph, you can connect nodes together and use them to tell your application what it should do, and in what order.

Flow Graphs can access a large collection of nodes, which correspond to different features and functionality in the Unity Editor. You can access these nodes through uNode Item Selector.

---

#### üîÅ Where Can You Use Flow Graphs?

Flow Graphs are used in multiple places in uNode:

| Location                    | Purpose |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| **State Nodes**             | Define what happens on `On Enter`, `On Update`, and `On Exit` |
| **Transition Nodes**        | Check if a condition is true before changing state |
| **Functions and Event Graph**      | Build logic for `Start()`, `Update()`, or custom events |
| **Constructors / Properties** | Initialize data or calculate values |

---

#### üß± What You Can Do in a Flow Graph

| Action                  | Example |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Call methods            | `PlayAnimation("Run")` |
| Set variables           | `Health = 0` |
| Check conditions        | `if (distance < 5)` |
| Use loops               | `for`, `while`, `foreach` |
| Handle events           | `On Trigger Enter`, `On Click` |
| Wait or delay           | `WaitForSeconds(1)` |
| Branch logic            | `If`, `Switch`, `Sequence` |

---

#### üîÑ How Does a Flow Graph Work?

1. The **flow starts** from an entry node like `Start`, `OnEnter`, or an event.
2. It travels along **wires** flow connecting nodes.
3. Each node performs a **action** (e.g., check condition, set value).
4. The logic continues until it reaches the end or loops.

---

### State Machine Graphs

In uNode Visual Scripting, a State Graph is the visual workspace where you build and manage a State Machine‚Äîa system that controls how your object behaves based on its current state.
You can have multiple state graph inside one graph file.

#### üîÑ What is a State Machine?

A **State Machine** is a system where only **one state is active at a time**, and your object switches between states based on conditions or events.

Examples of states:
- Idle
- Walk
- Jump
- Attack
- Dead

---

#### üé® What is a State Graph?

A **State Graph** is where you visually design and control a state machine using:
- **State Nodes** for behaviors
- **Transition Nodes** to move between states
- **Any State Node** for global transitions
- **Events** like `OnEnter`, `OnUpdate`, and `OnExit`

Only one state runs at a time, and you define how and when states change.

---

#### üì¶ Where Do I Find the State Graph in uNode?

In uNode, the **State Graph is embedded inside a Class Definition or C# Graph**.

The State Graphs is supported only on graph that's inherited from MonoBehavior or it's sub classes like:

- Class Component
- Class Singleton
- Graph Component
- C# Class that's inherited from MonoBehaviour or it's sub classes.

#### üîß What You Can Do Inside a State Graph

| Action                       | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Add **State Nodes**         | Represent different behaviors (e.g., Idle, Run, Attack) |
| Add **Transitions**         | Define how and when to switch between states |
| Use **Any State Node**      | Jump to a state from any active state (like interrupt or death) |
| Use **Nested States**       | Organize complex behavior into sub-graphs |
| Edit **Event Logic**        | Customize behavior with `On Enter`, `On Update`, and `On Exit` or other event nodes |

---

#### ‚úÖ Why Use a State Graph?

- Clear and visual behavior control
- Easier to debug and manage than big flow graphs
- Great for:
  - Character AI
  - Menus
  - Cutscenes
  - Game flow (start, puase, game over)
  - Animations
- Supports modular design using Nested States
